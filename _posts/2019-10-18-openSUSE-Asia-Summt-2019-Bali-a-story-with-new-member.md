openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 was held at Universitas Udayana - Bali on October 5-6, 2019. This summit was the third openSUSE.Asia Summit for me, the first is Yogyakarta 2016 and then Tokyo 2017. In the summit before i attend the summit with my friend in community call [GNU/Linux bogor](https://glibogor.or.id) and [openSUSE-ID](https://opensuse.id). My talks in this summit is something that me and my team work, about Kubenetes, monitoring and logging. So i sent a paper with the title `Deploy Monitoring and Centralized Logging with Prometheus + Grafana and EFK Stack on Kubic k8s cluster`.

The special about this summit for me is, before when the first and second summit i come with a woman who is a my girlfriend. And in this summit i attend with the woman that used to be girlfriend then later become my wife and mother of my daughter. 

#### The Summit

This years summit is very fun, the speakers and the attendees is have a great interaction. My talks was in day two. So i have a bit timeto touch up my presentation and labs, and something was happen in the lab for the demo some of my vm crash, so i need to repair it. :D

#### One Day Tour

We have tour in monday. We are going to ubud Rice Terrace. The view was great, and i need to do more work because i'm a bit fat now and the road is upside down. Then we are going to Sacred Monkey Forest Ubud. In this place we came to see a monkey, the monkey is cute, but some scary moment came when the monkey came to take something in my bag. The monkey came and trying to hug me to take something in my bag. :D

It's very great conference in the city which is beutiful and have a big culture.

Anyway, i would like to say thank you to all of team, volunteer and sponsor to make it successfull event.
