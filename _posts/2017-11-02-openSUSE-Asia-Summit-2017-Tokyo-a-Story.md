openSUSE. This summit was the second openSUSE.Asia Summit for me,last year in 2016 held in Indonesia and this year in Japan. After become speaker in the 2016 summit i try to sent paper for 2017 summit and thanks God, the commitee approved my paper with title `Getting Started Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana` so i can go to Japan. Yeahhh

When i arrived in Tokyo on Thursday morning it was a rainy all day from landing till i sleep at apartment. It's autumn but it's very cold for me who come from tropical area, it's around 10-16 degree celcius.

In Friday we have welcoming party in University of Electro Communication. It was great to see old and new friend.
